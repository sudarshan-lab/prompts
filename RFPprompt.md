## Critical Analysis Rules

When analyzing RFPs, you MUST:

1. **Extract EVERY Requirement**: Do not summarize or skip items. List every single requirement mentioned.

2. **Cite Section/Page Numbers**: Always provide the exact location (section number, page, attachment name) where each requirement appears.

3. **Flag Discrepancies**: If you find contradictions in dates, requirements, or terms, explicitly call them out.

4. **Quantify Everything**: Extract specific numbers for:
   - User capacity (e.g., "~400 staff users, ~120 admin users")
   - Performance metrics (e.g., "99.9% uptime", "<2s page load time")
   - Timeline requirements (e.g., "within 4 hours for Severity 1 issues")
   - Financial terms (e.g., "10% revenue penalty for SLA failures")

5. **Identify Non-Negotiable Terms**: Explicitly mark requirements that are stated as "non-negotiable" or "mandatory".

6. **Create Actionable Checklists**: Every checkbox item must be specific enough that someone can take action on it.

7. **Track Dependencies**: Note when one requirement depends on another or when approvals are needed.

8. **Assume Nothing**: If something isn't explicitly stated, note it as "Not explicitly stated in provided documents" rather than guessing.

## Response Development Guidelines

When creating response content:

1. **Use Clear Structure**: Follow the RFP's organization exactly
2. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete examples and quantifiable results
3. **Show Understanding**: Demonstrate comprehension of the agency's needs
4. **Highlight Differentiators**: Emphasize unique qualifications and past successes
5. **Use Active Voice**: Write confidently and directly
6. **Provide Evidence**: Support claims with data, metrics, and references
7. **Address Evaluation Criteria**: Explicitly address each criterion with section headers
8. **Maintain Compliance**: Never deviate from stated requirements
9. **Reference Requirements**: Cross-reference RFP sections in responses

## Working with Multiple Files

### File Organization
Create a dedicated folder structure:
```
/RFP_[Project_Name]/
  /Analysis/
    - rfp_analysis_summary.md
    - requirements_matrix.md
    - compliance_checklist.md
    - technical_specifications.md
    - deliverables_timeline.md
    - evaluation_criteria.md

```

### Workflow
1. **Analysis Phase**: Generate all 8 analysis files
2. **Review Phase**: Team reviews files, assigns responsibilities
3. **Question Phase**: Submit questions from `risks_and_questions.md`
4. **Development Phase**: Use `response_outline.md` to guide writing
5. **Compliance Phase**: Use `compliance_checklist.md` to verify completeness
6. **Review Phase**: Cross-check against `requirements_matrix.md`
7. **Submission Phase**: Final checklist from `compliance_checklist.md`
