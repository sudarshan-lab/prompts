# RFP ANALYSIS SUMMARY

## Basic Information

[cite_start]**RFP Title**: Recreation Management System [cite: 14]
[cite_start]**Solicitation Number**: RFP 2000004237 [cite: 10]
[cite_start]**Issuing Agency**: County of Fairfax, Virginia - Department of Procurement and Material Management [cite: 3, 28]
[cite_start]**Due Date**: February 20, 2025 @ 2:00 PM EST [cite: 15] (See Critical Flags regarding Year)
**Estimated Value**: Not explicitly stated; implied high value due to revenue-based penalties.
**Contract Term**: Not explicitly stated in provided text; [cite_start]Addendum 1 implies planning for "next 3-5 years"[cite: 25].

## Critical Flags and Alerts

[cite_start]⚠️ **Date Discrepancy**: Addendum 1 is dated 12/22/2025 [cite: 13] [cite_start]and Addendum 2 is dated 01/15/2026 [cite: 68][cite_start], but both list the Due Date as February 20, **2025**[cite: 15, 64]. This is physically impossible if the addenda were issued in late 2025/2026. It is highly likely the due date is February 20, **2026**.
⚠️ **Missing Documentation**: The Main RFP document (containing evaluation weights, detailed scope, and standard instructions) was not provided for this analysis. This analysis relies on Addenda 1 & 2, Appendix A, and Attachments 1, 3, & 4.
[cite_start]⚠️ **Non-Negotiable Terms**: Attachment J (IT Services Provider Consultant/Contractor Agreement) is non-negotiable[cite: 640].
[cite_start]⚠️ **Aggressive Penalties**: 10% revenue credit penalty for failure to meet performance metrics or service availability[cite: 787].

## At-a-Glance Complexity Assessment

- **Overall Complexity**: **High** (Due to strict SLA penalties and integration requirements).
- [cite_start]**Technical Complexity**: **High** (Requires Active-Active failover, integration with SAP/FOCUS and GIS)[cite: 593, 744].
- **Compliance Complexity**: **Medium** (Standard government forms, but strict "non-negotiable" agreement).
- **Key Challenges**:
    - [cite_start]Meeting <2 second page load times to avoid revenue penalties[cite: 768, 787].
    - [cite_start]Integrating with legacy SAP-based ERP (FOCUS)[cite: 593].
    - Validating the actual due date year immediately.
